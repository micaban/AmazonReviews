This work focuses on the analysis of two review data streams of Amazon products. The first one is composed of the reviews corresponding to the products in the AmazonBasics category. The latter collects reviews of the products in the Telegram channels known for giving products for free in exchange for 5-star reviews. The analysis reveals a substantial dissimilarity between the two sources of reviews, that conducts to the construction of a ground truth dataset employed in the machine learning classification model training. The classification activity can assist during product rating interpretation, which could be invalidated by too many fake reviews. The experimental results reveal that 1&2-star reviews are good predictors of the review’s trustworthiness and the product itself.
